# Local Shop Discovery 🛍️

A web application designed to help users discover local retail shops and their collections digitally before stepping out onto the physical shopping streets.

The platform focuses on **offline-first retail discovery**, enabling shops to showcase their offerings without the complexities of online ordering, payments, or logistics.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Local shopping districts often suffer from:
* **High Crowds:** Heavy footfall makes browsing difficult.
* **Limited Visibility:** Customers don't know what’s inside a shop until they enter.
* **Time Inefficiency:** Customers spend hours visiting multiple shops to find one item.
* **Lost Revenue:** Shop owners lose high-intent customers who walk past without noticing their specific collection.

Existing e-commerce platforms don't solve this because many customers still prefer to **see, touch, and try** products in person.

## 🎯 Solution
Local Shop Discovery brings the right customers to the right shop at the right time by providing:
* A unified directory for local shop details and collections.
* Discovery via category, price range, and availability filters.
* High-intent shortlisting to save time during physical visits.
* **Zero-risk for owners:** No online selling, no delivery, and no return logistics.

---

## 👥 Target Users
### Customers
* Want to plan shopping trips in advance.
* Prefer offline shopping but need clarity on stock/style before visiting.
* Searching for specific budgets or aesthetics.

### Shop Owners
* Local retail owners seeking digital visibility.
* Want to attract serious buyers without e-commerce overhead.
